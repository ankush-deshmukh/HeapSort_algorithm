## Sorting algorithm
### Heap and Heapsort


### Overview
Heapsort is an algorithm which is used for sorting an unsorted dataset. For example binary tree.
Heap is a data structure which maintain maximum or minimum value in the dataset. Heap which mainatain the max value called Max-heap and for minimum value called Min-heap.
Heap has basic two funtionalities
- The root is the maximum value in the dataset
- Every parant's value is greater than ites children
Heapsort-> algorithm uses the heap data structure to to maintain the max value at root and extract that max value from dataset. while extracting the max value from the tree/list it rebalance the tree so that it should not violet the heap properties.
It return the extracted values in the list as a sorted list.


### Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Works on Linux, Windows, macOS


### Usage

```python
git clone https://github.com/ankush-deshmukh/HeapSort_algorithm

cd Heap_and_HeapSort

python main.py
```
